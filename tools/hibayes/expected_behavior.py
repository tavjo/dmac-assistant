"""T0.2 — Deterministic `task_family → ExpectedBehavior` rule function.

Locked-spec anchors:
- DD-30: pattern-based Python rule function (deterministic, no LLM)
- DL-021 (2026-05-15): user-approved 22-row mapping (source of truth)
- DL-013 / R15: `Unsupported` family resolves to `StateUnsupportedBoundary` as
  the coarse default. The 5 corpus queries in this family split across ≥4
  distinct semantic behaviors (GenerateArtifact / AnswerDirectly /
  StateUnsupportedBoundary / ClarifyIfAmbiguous), but the `(task_family,)`
  signature has no axis to disambiguate. Known accuracy loss is documented
  in the Risk Register row R15. Revisiting this requires a new DD with
  explicit user direction.

Build-plan anchors:
- DL-027: executor-forcing pinning of the 22-row mapping source-of-truth.
  The 22 pairs are encoded as a flat dict literal in EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR_BY_FAMILY
  below; any divergence from the locked-design table cell-for-cell is a defect.
- Path B / DL-029 (2026-05-16): the enum distribution
  `{AnswerDirectly: 13, GenerateArtifact: 4, UsePriorContext: 2,
   StateUnsupportedBoundary: 1, RefuseUnsafeOnly: 2}` (sum = 22) is the
  operative result of applying this rule across FAMILIES_22. This diverges from
  locked-design line 318's `AnswerDirectly (14 families)` summary because that
  line is an arithmetic-error summary; the row enumeration at lines 295-316 is
  canonical (and contains exactly 13 AnswerDirectly entries).

Project memory:
- `feedback_categorize_with_full_corpus_context.md` 2026-05-15: Write-Create
  and Write-Update both resolve to `RefuseUnsafeOnly` (NOT `ClarifyIfAmbiguous`).
  Rationale anchor: the `Write-safety on NExtSEEK` paragraph of `container/CLAUDE.md` destructive-NExtSEEK-op
  confirmation policy.
